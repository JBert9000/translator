Here I am making a simple command line dictoinary application where the user inputs the word, and the program spits out a definition of that word in German. Works perfectly for me as I want to learn German right now. 

I am following one of the tutorials from this course: https://www.udemy.com/the-python-mega-course/

I got my own json formated file as a dictionary source from this URL: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hathibelagal/German-English-JSON-Dictionary/master/english_german.json

Got the English to Polish data from here: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/djstrong/PL-Wiktionary-To-Dictionary/master/dictionaries/english_polish.txt
